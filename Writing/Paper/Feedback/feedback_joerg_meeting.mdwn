# Feedback 

- examples
  - connect examples better to theory/concepts under investigation
  - rather stick to studies than broad real-life examples: explain the experimental setup

- structure
    - use operational definitions
    - too broad at the end of paragraphs

- title 
    - does not make sense 
    - too unspecific

- abstract 
  - too unspecific and broad
  - define environments
  - remove leadership example for implications
  - define all terms
  - his summary
    - define terms
    - unclear what it's about
    - unclear what I did 

- introduction
  - his summary
    - structure is missing, foundation, research question
    - transitions and "storyline" missing 
    - examples are arbitrary, not theoretical
    - avoid hyperbolic or metaphorical statements (too vague)
    - concepts not clearly defined
    - sentences copied from other papers
  - too unscientific
  - terms without context
  - company marketing example out of place; better for reputation management
  - competition does not typically lead to trust and cooperation (use strong evidence)
  - more on partner selection (use biological markets as entry point)
  - more theoretical foundation, instead of examples
  - avoid metaphors if they are not theoretically grounded
  - copied sentences from other papers including his

- references
  - use scientific statements, not psychological assessments or the like
  - describe studies 

- method section
  - avoid add-ins -> find a better structure

## Outline

### Introduction 

#### Currently

- people follow norms
  - broad intro
  - good norms
  - bad norms
- people also violate norms
  - define corrupt collaboration
  - examples
  - expand on the environment, incentives (why some groups have norms of trust, cooperation, morality while others foster anti-social behavior) 
  - then connect to broader theoretical foundation
- trusting good interaction partners
  - connection to previous paragraph? 
  - define rule following
  - use trustworthy/signalling willingness of pro-sociality (more literature there)
- morality predicts intentions
- partner selection in economic games

#### Now

**Hypotheses**
1. Norms of rule-following will establish over time. 
   1. Scores will increase in the fair environment
   2. Scores will decrease in the corrupt environment
2. Rule-following scores in the first shown environment will anchor scores in the second shown environment. 
3. Rule violators will be selected 
   1. more often in the corrupt environment
   2. less often in the fair environment

**Concepts**
1. rule-following scores, cheating vs fair environment
   1. biological markets
   2. reputation
   3. DG DRG
2. anchoring trends
3. partner choice

**Research questions** 
- How much do social environments anchor rule following?
- And when are rule violators preferred over rule followers?

**Elements needed**
1. Norms will establish over time
   1. economic games 
      1. prosociality: follow social norms
      2. cheating: violate social norms
   2. time variable
   3. scores can change over time
      1.  DG: prosociality
      2.  DRG: corrupt collaboration
2. Anchoring effect
   1. ?
3. Differential partner choice 
   1. biological markets / competition
   2. partner choice
   3. desirable interaction partners / expected reciprocity
   4. reputation / image scores

**Argumentation**
1. Norms will establish over time
2. Anchoring effect
3. Differential partner choice
