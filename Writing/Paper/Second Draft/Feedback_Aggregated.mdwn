**Include**
- Would extend – talk about the environment, incentives in the environment – why do some groups/societies have norms of trust, cooperation, and morality, while others establish norms that foster anti-social behavior? Then, you can also connect your examples to a broader theoretical foundation.
- Why moral? Why not simply trustworthy / signal willingness of pro-sociality (which is more clearly defined in the literature)? 
- What are biological markets? Define!
- You need to talk about the role of partner selection, not only mention it as a sidenote.
- Again, this are interesting examples, but it is not clear for what exactly, because your theoretical foundation is lacking. 

**Reuse**
- This is good; You introduce  a new theoretical  concept (asymmetry) and then clearly define it with abstract  (resources etc.) and “real life”(banks etc.) examples. 
- Why not talk about this study (Keizer, Lindenberg, & Steg, 2008) in more detail instead of using broad real-life examples that may lose their relevancy in some years from now.

## Structure

1. Do individuals follow rules differently across environments?
2. And are they chosen differently across those environments? 

3. RQ: Can switching from a corrupt environment to a fair environment make individuals more rule following?
4. RQ: Are dishonest partners preferred in corrupt environments and prosocial partners preferred in fair environmnents?

### In a nutshell - Intro

Cooperation such as rule following, for instance, is key for societies to function. [def]. [ex]. However, groups can also collaborate to violate rules. Previous research has hightlighted the importance of incentives in social environments and partner choice in solving these seemingly contradictory behaviors. 

- When individuals cooperate there are costs and benefits for at least one of the involved parties, and costs however pose a risk that may or may not be related to attempts of exploitation. To shield themselves from being exploited, parties evaluate how trustworthy others are. [ex]. In fact, individuals readily signal their trustworthiness to show others that they are able and willing to cooperate. For instance, charity [ex]. Also, research has shown that the willingness outweighs the ability to confer benefits on others. [ex]. Importantly, signals are considered reliable when they are rather costly for some to perform or others do not possess the qualities in the first place. [ex]. Therefore, cooperation requires some form of safety from the parties involved. 
- [reciprocity] Reciprocity is a well documented way of safeguarding cooperation and is most likely when group members know each other. Evolutionary mechanisms, for instance, point to kin selection where individuals are more likely to reciprocate help from relatives than non-relatives, and group selection where individuals serve the existence of a group and, thereby, reciprocate. However, in the face of globalization, individuals interact less frequently with and do not necessarily know each other which, in turn, gradually removes incentives to reciprocate. [ex]. Therefore, cooperation in anonymous groups requires another mechanism. 
- Indirect reciprocity is a well documented way of safeguarding cooperation when group members do not know each other and social interactions are limited to one. This form of reciprocity occurs when an observer helps an individual because the observer saw that individual helping someone else. [ex]. Indirect reciprocity is the underlying mechanism of reputation, the public opinion of a person [def]. [ex]. Therefore, individuals use the reputation of others to evaluate whether they are a good interaction partner. 
- Reputation has also been described as a universal currency for social interactions, and individuals treat it as such. They deliberately manage their reputation and keep score of others' signals - whether deliberately or not. [ex]. This is called image scoring, a social measure where multiple signals of cooperation for a reputation score over time  
- Reputation draws on signaling theory with reputation being a social measure of multiple signals over time and, importantly, individuals keep score of others' reputation. This is also known as image scoring. 
- individuals choose others who they want to interact with such as their partners, friends, and colleagues at work, and in doing so they choose those who display desirable characteristics - whether intentionally or unintentionally - and abandon those who do not. This is also called a biological market, where different from economic markets, individuals do not trade goods or services but their ability and willingness to confer benefits on others. [ex]. Therefore, the benefits and selection pressures that come with biological markets establish incentive structures where some benefits are more desirable than others. 
- Integral to biological markets is partner choice, the process of individuals choosing others as interaction partners, and in addition to the inherent property of biological markets of creating incentive structures, asymmetries in partner choice often exist. Asymmetric partner choice occurs when some individuals have more potential partners at their disposal and ready to choose from than others. [ex]. These asymmetries in partner choice also fortify already existing incentives. [ex]. Therefore, partner choice asymmetrically incentivizes qualities and thereby increases pressures to be categorized as a good interaction partner. 
- Importantly, partner choice is contingent on qualities that are considered desirable. Specifically, cooperators are more likely to be chosen while non-cooperators are more likely to be abandoned. For instance, when it is desirable to follow rules [ex]. Reversely, when it is desirable to violate rules [ex]. Therefore, partner choice determines rule following. 


- One important component in biological markets is partner choice. Partner choice is operationally defined as [def]. When some individuals have more potential partners at their disposal and ready to choose from while others do not, asymmetries in partner choice exist. When partner choice asymmetries exist in biological markets, incentive structures are established with desirable behaviors being unilaterally enforced and undesirable behaviors implicitly punished. Since biological markets enforce desirable behaviors and implicitly punish undesirable behaviors

- partner choice
- signaling trustworthiness: reciprocity (prosociality / anti-social behavior)
  - partner switching
- competitive altruism

Environments
When in groups, those individuals who are able to choose others for partnership, prefer those who signal their willingness to reciprocate, and with increasing availability of partners, competitors become increasingly altruistic. 

Reversely, instead of signaling altruism, competitors can also signal their willigness to defect, especially in anonymous settings. Similarly to altruism, corruption has been shown to breed corruption. [ex]. 

Rule following also carries over when switching from one social environment to another, with each environment having its own social norms. Specifically, norms have been shown to carry over to corrupt environments. [milinski]. 

Partner choice
Not only social environments have been shown to influence rule following, but partner choice as well. Specifically, individuals who are able to choose group members for partnership can choose to include or exclude members, thereby enforcing desirable behaviors as well as implicitly punishing less desirable behaviors. 

In addition, the possibility of partner switching increases competition among group members for desirable behaviors. 

However, different from previous research, participants dynamically learn each others' rule following scores. 

Dump
- In this regard, individuals who signal their trustworthiness appear more attractive to others for future social interactions. Specifically, signaling theory holds that when parties have different information they can resolve the problem by honestly communicating, also called signaling, their ability and willingness to cooperate. For instance, individuals [ex].
- In order to do so, individuals signal their trustworthiness to others and they do so by showing that they reciprocate. direct reciprocity is one way of such safety and occurs when, say, person A asks person B for a favor and person B returns the favor directly to person A. 
- Rule following has been studied widely in behavioral economics, where economic games have shown that rule following increases in step-level games as opposed to one-shot games.  
- This competition has been shown to reverse, so that competitors become more corrupt when anonymity exists in addition to other factors. 
- narrow demand and thereby broaden supply, inadvertently increasing competition.
