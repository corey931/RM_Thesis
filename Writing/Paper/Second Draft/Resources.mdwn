## Cooperation

- Humans frequently cooperate to achieve mutual goals. Successful cooperation can lead to better performance, higher innovation, and better overall outcomes (e.g., Rusbult & Van Lange, 2003). Providing people with the freedom to seek trustworthy partners and abandon free riders helps to develop and safeguard cooperation (Efferson, Roca, Vogt, & Helbing, 2016; Rand, Arbesman, & Christakis, 2011).

## Norms

- Centralized Sanctions and Leadership In contrast to most recent experimental studies ofnorms and sanctions, real-world collective action groups generally place restrictions on who can punish whom for violating norms (e.g., Ostrom 2000). For instance, the responsibility for monitoring and sanctioning others’ behaviors might be alternated among group members (O’Gorman et al. 2009) or based implicitly on who has more power or influence in the group (e.g., Przepiorka & Diekmann 2013). Perhaps most commonly, the ability to sanction others’ behaviors is often vested in an explicitly designated leader (van Vugt & De Cremer 1999). (Beyond Altruism: Sociologi)

## Reputation

- REPUTATIONS
In the last decade, perhaps no mechanism promoting cooperation and prosocial behavior has received as much attention as reputation. Once viewed as secondary to material incentives, the reputational rewards that go to those who behave in generous or cooperative ways are now also viewed as a powerful force shaping prosocial action. Researchers generally conceive of reputation as the “set of judgments a community makes about the personal qualities of one of its members” (Emler 1990, p. 171). Here we are particularly concerned with reputational judgments with moral content, specifically judgments of a person’s cooperativeness, trustworthiness, or generosity. (Beyond Altruism: Sociologi)

## Corruption

- no differences in corruption across countries (Cut From the Same Cloth:
Similarly Dishonest Individuals Across Countries)
- In collaborative settings in which people work together, one’s behavior may affect the partner’s behavior. Indeed, unethical behavior, such as helping someone else cheat on an exam, can be learned from observing peers, colleagues, and even strangers (O’Fallon & Butterfield, 2012). Merely seeing someone lie facilitates imitation of such behavior (Kocher, Schudy, & Spantig, 2017; Soraperra et al., 2017), being exposed to norm violations increases subsequent norm violation (Keizer, Lindenberg, & Steg, 2008), and the more prevalent cor- ruption is in a country, the more likely people from that country are to violate rules (Gächter & Schulz, 2016). Furthermore, because people do not like to be excluded (Kurzban & Leary, 2001), and are even willing to violate rules that benefit the group to avoid being excluded (Thau, Derfler-Rozin, Pitesa, Mitchell, & Pillutla, 2015), honest people might adapt their behav- ior and start lying to prevent their dishonest partners from leaving them.

- However, cooperation is also an essential part of corruption (Köbis, van Prooijen, Righetti, & Van Lange, 2016; Weisel & Shalvi, 2015). People often engage in corrupt collaboration—the attainment of per- sonal profits by joint acts of rule violation (Weisel & Shalvi, 2015).

### Dishonesty 

- Previous studies have revealed that working with other people leads to more dishonesty than working alone (Conrads, Irlenbusch, Rilke, & Walkowitz, 2013; Gino, Ayal, & Ariely, 2013; Sutter, 2009; Weisel & Shalvi, 2015), prosocial lies breed trust (Levine & Schweitzer, 2015), and working with the same partner over time increases bribery as people develop trust (Abbink, 2004). Outside the laboratory, however, people can often choose how long and with whom to interact. Do dishonest people search for a dishonest partner—a “partner in crime”? dishonesty. Such behavior is comparable with free riding in a public- goods dilemma in which people may profit from others’ contributions to a public good while not contributing themselves (Andreoni, 1988).

## Partner Choice

- The ability to choose partners allows people who are willing to violate rules (in the present case, lie) to increase personal profit by abandoning those who are not willing to cooperate (Reuben & Stephenson, 2013). studies have shown that people do not lie much, even when lying is profitable (Abeler, Nosenzo, & Raymond, 2016); they avoid situations that may tempt them to lie (Fishbach, Friedman, & Kruglanski, 2003); and they prefer to interact with those who are similar (Currarini, Jackson, & Pin, 2009). people care about seeing themselves as moral but at the the same time seek to maximize personal profit (Mazar, Amir, & Ariely, 2008). To maintain such an honest self- image, people use various self-serving justifications when violating rules (Ayal & Gino, 2011; Shalvi, Gino, Barkan, & Ayal, 2015).
