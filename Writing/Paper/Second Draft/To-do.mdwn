## Ask 

- buzz words in results section: frequency, modulate, increase, depend
- as someone more experienced, how long does it take you to write a paper by now? 

## Feedback (10-06-2020)

- experimental tasks (theoretical level): what they measure, then implement, then order, number of rounds
- connect tasks back to intro asked to follow rules but costly, but has benefits; or hypothetical 
- die rolling: expect 6es and what partners to expect, binary tree going through options (briefly for hypotheses)

- end of methods, outline analysis, use R package to derive p-values
- what i test, conclude, and order
- most important, follows...
- behavioral; frequency/propensity of rule following; what is surprising (put it at the end)

- partner choices [manipulation checks], partner selectors
- condition 1/2 labels
- discussion: connect to intro (what have we learned?)
- dishonesty and bankers, especially when framing task in their profession (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13977)
