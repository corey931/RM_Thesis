## Overview

**RQ**
1. Do individuals follow rules differently across environments? / Can switching from a corrupt environment to a fair environment make individuals more rule following?
2. And are they chosen differently across those environments? / Are dishonest partners preferred in corrupt environments and prosocial partners preferred in fair environmnents?

**Hypotheses**
1. Norms of rule-following will establish over time. 
   1. Scores will increase in the fair environment
   2. Scores will decrease in the corrupt environment
2. Rule-following scores in the first shown environment will anchor scores in the second shown environment. 
3. Rule violators will be selected 
   1. more often in the corrupt environment
   2. less often in the fair environment
