## Intro

### In a nutshell

Cooperation such as rule following, for instance, is key for societies to function. [def]. [ex]. However, cooperation is not prosocial per se. Instead, groups can also collaborate to violate rules. Previous research has hightlighted the importance of incentives in social environments and partner choice in solving these seemingly contradictory behaviors. 

Environments
When in groups, those individuals who are able to choose others for partnership, prefer those who signal their willingness to reciprocate, and with increasing availability of partners, competitors become increasingly altruistic. 

Reversely, instead of signaling altruism, competitors can also signal their willigness to defect, especially in anonymous settings. Similarly to altruism, corruption has been shown to breed corruption. [ex]. 

In addition, rule following has been shown to carry over when switching from one social environment to another, with each environment having its own social norms. Specifically, norms have been shown to carry over to corrupt environments. [milinski]. 

Partner choice
Not only social environments have been shown to influence rule following, but partner choice as well. Specifically, individuals who are able to choose group members for partnership can choose to include or exclude members, thereby enforcing desirable behaviors as well as implicitly punishing less desirable behaviors. 

### Argument in more detail (maybe for the discussion)

Individuals compete to choose and be chosen for social interactions. This is called a biological market. But unlike economic markets where goods and services are traded, biological markets mainly focus on the ability and willingness to benefit others. For instance, peers, non-peers [ex]. Biological markets are therefore a place where individuals are required to cooperate through quality signaling and partner choice. However, markets do not exist in a vacuum, rather, in an environment that shapes interactions through its incentive structure, and it is this structure that can shape individuals' signals and which partners they choose. 

Cooperation can be both costly and beneficial. To mitigate costs individuals therefore draw on signals of trustworthiness. Specifically, signals of indirect reciprocity are commonly used as an index of such trustworthiness through reputation. Since people update their public opinions of others, they are also suspect to such updating by others and, in turn, manage their own reputation. 

Partner choice is an integral part of biological markets. [def]. Those who choose have been shown to prefer the willingness to confer benefits over the availability to do so. [ex]. In addition, those choosing have been shown to enforce which qualities are desirable by excluding competitors to maximize their profit. [ex]. However, who gets chosen has been found to be conditional on the goals of the individual choosing. For instance, in a prosocial environment individuals prosocial behavior is preferred [ref] and, therefore, leads to cooperation. [ex]. However, individuals also cooperate to corrupt. In fact, in a corrupt environment, people have been shown to prefer corrupt collaboration, the joint violation of rules for the sake of gaining benefits. H1. 

Moreover, both prosociality and corrupt collaboration can manifest as social norms over time. Social norms are commonly defined as behaviors that should be commonly acted out (i.e., injunctive norms) or are indeed commonly acted out (i.e., descriptive norms). [ex]. Previous research has examined these concepts by looking at rule-following behavior. In addition, behavior has been shown to breed behavior with prosociality increasing the frequency of following prosociality. Specifically, [blabla] have shown the impact of descriptive norms of a neighborhood on household electricity consumption. Similarly, corruption has been shown to breed corruption. [blabla] has shown that. 

### Full-fledged

Cooperation such as rule-following, for instance, is key to the functioning of societies. For instance, policy makers, legislators, and university councils all establish and administrate rules. People can be prosocial, follow rules, and therewith act in the best interest of a group as a whole. Cooperation, however, is not always prosocial. Instead, people can defect as a collective in the face of better benefits, a concept called corrupt collaboration [ref]. This form of corruption only benefits those defecting and comes at the expense of others. While the consequences of prosocial behavior are largely considered positive [ref] with examples of moral character [ref] and trustworthiness [ref], the consequences of corrupt collaboration can be disastrous. [ex] For instance, . We, therefore, have to investigate when groups cooperate for prosocial reasons and when groups corrupt.

#### From Costly Signaling to Reputation Management

When individuals cooperate, all involved parties have to consider both the costs and the benefits. Importantly, costs can be exploitation attempts, risks that are better avoided if possible. To shield themselves from being exploited, individuals evaluate how trustworthy others are. [ex]. Individuals readily signal their trustworthiness. For instance, charity [ex]. Importantly, signals are considered reliable when they are rather costly for some to perform or others do not possess the qualities in the first place. [ex]. Therefore, cooperation requires trustworthiness among the parties involved as a safety mechanism. 

Reciprocity is a well-documented way of safeguarding cooperation and is most likely when group members know each other. Evolutionary mechanisms, for instance, point to kin selection where individuals are more likely to reciprocate help from relatives than non-relatives, and group selection where individuals serve the existence of a group and, thereby, reciprocate. However, in the face of globalization, individuals interact less frequently and do not necessarily know each other which, in turn, gradually removes incentives to reciprocate. [ex]. Therefore, cooperation in anonymous groups requires another mechanism. 

Indirect reciprocity is such a way of safeguarding cooperation when group members do not know each other and social interactions are limited to one. This form of reciprocity occurs when an observer helps an individual because the observer saw that individual helping someone else. [ex]. Indirect reciprocity is the underlying mechanism of reputation, the public opinion of a person [def]. [ex]. Therefore, individuals use the reputation of others to evaluate whether they are a good interaction partner. 
  
Reputation has been described as a universal currency for social interactions, and individuals treat it as such. The concept of the updating strategy is based on individuals keeping score of others' and their signals. Within this concept, various models conceptualize reputation differently. For example, the standing strategy explains how, in the context of helping, all group members already start with a good reputation score and can loose their good standing if they fail to help, thus, reducing their score. However, this model did not prevail over the scoring strategy. The scoring model holds that group members' reputation scores rise and fall with their acts of help. [ex]. Such updating strategies are reasons for individuals to deliberately manage their reputation, also called reputation management. [ex]. Therefore, individuals manage and care about others' impressions of them. 

#### Partner Choice in Biological Markets

Reputation management is vital for biological markets where individuals compete to choose and be chosen as interaction partners. Unlike economic markets where goods and services are traded, biological markets focus on the ability and willingness to benefit others. Hunter-gatherer tribes, peers [ex]. Importantly, the willingness to benefit is more important than the ability to do so. For instance, [blabla] found that generosity prevails over productivity [ex]. Reputation, therefore, plays a vital role in biological markets.

However, in a market, supply commonly follows demand. Specifically, individuals compete to be chosen but also choose who they want to interact with such as their partners, friends, and colleagues at work, a concept we refer to here as partner choice. Importantly, reputation helps individuals choosing good interaction partners [ex]. Therefore, if competitors do not have a desirable reputation they will not be chosen as partners and will thus miss out on potential benefits [ex]. Partner choice, therefore, creates selection pressures for competitors.  

Which qualities are considered desirable is conditional on the goals of the individual choosing. For instance, in a prosocial environment, signals of prosociality are preferred [ref] and, therefore, lead to cooperation. [ex]. However, individuals also cooperate to corrupt. In fact, in a corrupt environment, people have been shown to prefer corrupt collaboration, the joint violation of rules for the sake of gaining benefits. [ex]. H1.  

#### Cooperation Within and Across Environments

Both prosociality and corrupt collaboration can increase in frequency in the form of social norms over time. Social norms are commonly defined as common behaviors that either should be acted out (i.e., injunctive norms) or are indeed acted out (i.e., descriptive norms). [ex]. For instance, previous research has examined social norms in prosocial environments with prosocial behavior increasing future acts of prosociality over time. For instance, [blabla] competitive altruism. Similar to prosocial behavior, corruption has been shown to breed corruption. [blabla] has shown that. H2.

Moreover, social environments have been shown to interact when individuals switch from one environment to another. Specifically, when participants were exposed to a prosocial environment followed by a dishonest environment, the participants were more prosocial in the corrupt environment than if they had not been exposed to the prosocial environment in the first place. For instance, [blabla] has shown that cooperation stayed high when reputation. Also, when the environments were reversed, participants became more corrupt. [blablabla] has shown that. H3.
